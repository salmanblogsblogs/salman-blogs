      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we work. By 2030, AI will reshape industries, automate repetitive tasks, and create new job opportunities. Understanding this shift is critical for professionals, students, and businesses.</p>
      <p>This guide explores which jobs are most vulnerable, the emerging AI-driven careers, the essential skills you need, and practical steps to thrive in an AI-powered world.</p>

      <h2 id="jobs-risk">1. Jobs Most at Risk</h2>
      <p>AI excels in tasks that are repetitive, predictable, and rules-based. Roles that primarily involve manual processing, routine interactions, or standard operations are at high risk.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Entry Clerks:</strong> AI systems can process large volumes of data faster and more accurately.</li>
        <li><strong>Cashiers:</strong> Automated checkouts and AI kiosks reduce the need for humans.</li>
        <li><strong>Factory Line Workers:</strong> Robotics replace repetitive assembly and packaging tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Administrative Assistants:</strong> AI virtual assistants can handle scheduling, email, and queries.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic Customer Support:</strong> AI chatbots efficiently handle repetitive FAQs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="emerging-careers">2. Emerging AI-Driven Careers</h2>
      <p>AI also creates entirely new roles. These careers require humans to leverage AI for decision-making, creativity, or oversight.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Engineers & ML Specialists:</strong> Build and maintain AI systems for diverse industries.</li>
