        <!-- 1 Holographic Displays -->
        <h2 id="holographic">1. Holographic Displays</h2>
        <p>By 2030, smartphones might project <strong>3D holograms</strong> directly from the device. This means you could see life-like images in the air, making video calls and games much more immersive. Imagine attending a virtual meeting where participants appear as holograms in your room.</p>
        <p>Holographic displays could also replace traditional screens for gaming, learning, and social media. Movies and videos may appear around you, giving a theater-like experience without extra equipment. Designers and developers are already experimenting with tiny lasers and light field technology to make this possible.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>3D video calls with realistic avatars</li>
          <li>Immersive games and movies</li>
          <li>Interactive learning with holographic models</li>
          <li>Virtual presentations in your own room</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practical tip: When holographic devices arrive, they may need more space and clear surroundings to work effectively. Make sure you have enough room for full projection.</p>

        <!-- 2 AI-Powered Assistants -->
        <h2 id="ai-assistants">2. Fully AI-Powered Assistants</h2>
        <p>AI assistants will become far smarter by 2030. Instead of only responding to commands, they will predict what you need. For example, your phone could remind you to drink water, order groceries, or adjust your schedule automatically. These assistants will act almost like a personal secretary living inside your phone.</p>
        <p>They will also help manage finances, suggest health tips, and optimize your workday. For families, AI assistants could schedule school pickups, manage groceries, or track shared tasks efficiently.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Predicts needs before you ask</li>
          <li>Manages daily routines automatically</li>
          <li>Provides health and lifestyle suggestions</li>
          <li>Coordinates schedules for families or teams</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practical tip: To get the most from AI assistants, you will likely need to share basic data. Privacy controls will become essential to maintain security and personal comfort.</p>

        <!-- 3 Mind-Control Interfaces -->
        <h2 id="mind-control">3. Mind-Control Interfaces</h2>
        <p>By 2030, smartphones may respond to brain signals. You could open apps, type messages, or scroll through feeds simply by thinking about it. This will be revolutionary for people with disabilities and anyone who wants to use their devices hands-free.</p>
        <p>Research is already underway with non-invasive sensors that can read neural activity. While it might sound like science fiction, early experiments have successfully allowed users to control simple devices using thought patterns.</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>Practical tip: Battery health will remain important. Using energy-efficient apps and settings will help prolong battery lifespan even further.</p>

        <!-- 6 Built-in Health Scanners -->
        <h2 id="health">6. Built-in Health Scanners</h2>
        <p>Phones will likely include health-monitoring sensors. These could measure heart rate, blood sugar, hydration, oxygen levels, and even stress. Some devices might detect early warning signs for diseases and alert users to seek medical help.</p>
        <p>This technology could reduce the need for multiple gadgets like fitness bands, glucometers, or thermometers. Smartphones may become mini health stations for daily monitoring.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monitor heart rate, blood sugar, and hydration</li>
          <li>Track stress and sleep patterns</li>
          <li>Provide early alerts for potential health issues</li>
          <li>Help manage medications and appointments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practical tip: These health sensors will complement, not replace, regular medical checkups. Always consult professionals for serious health concerns.</p>

        <!-- 7 Satellite Connectivity -->
        <h2 id="satellite">7. Satellite Connectivity</h2>
        <p>By 2030, smartphones may connect directly to satellites. This means you could make calls or browse the internet anywhere, even in remote mountains, deserts, or oceans. No need to depend on cell towers or Wi-Fi availability.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Global connectivity anywhere</li>
          <li>Useful for travelers, explorers, and rural areas</li>
          <li>Emergency services access in remote locations</li>
          <li>Reliable internet during natural disasters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practical tip: Satellite connectivity may consume more battery, so energy-efficient designs will be critical.</p>

        <!-- 8 Smarter Cameras -->
        <h2 id="cameras">8. Smarter Cameras</h2>
        <p>AI-driven cameras will automatically adjust settings         for perfect photos. Lighting, angles, and editing could be handled automatically, making it easy for anyone to take professional-quality images without prior knowledge.</p>
        <p>AI could also recognize faces, scenes, or objects and optimize settings instantly. For example, if you’re taking a sunset picture, the camera could enhance colors and exposure automatically. Social media content creation will become much faster and visually appealing.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic scene detection for photos and videos</li>
          <li>AI-based object removal or enhancement</li>
          <li>Professional-quality results without editing apps</li>
          <li>Instant optimization for social media posting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practical tip: With smarter cameras, you will still need good lighting for best results, but the AI will help reduce common mistakes like blurry or underexposed shots.</p>

        <!-- 9 Full Augmented Reality Integration -->
        <h2 id="ar">9. Full Augmented Reality Integration</h2>
        <p>AR will go far beyond games. Smartphones may overlay directions on the road, show how furniture fits in your home, or create interactive educational experiences. Students could visualize complex science concepts in 3D and professionals could design products in AR before building them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigation arrows projected in real world</li>
          <li>Try furniture or products in your space before buying</li>
          <li>Interactive educational tools with 3D models</li>
