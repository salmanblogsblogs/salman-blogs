        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a game-changer for businesses of all sizes. While large enterprises were the first to adopt AI technologies, 2025 is seeing a surge in small businesses leveraging AI to improve efficiency, enhance customer experience, and increase revenue. From marketing automation to predictive analytics, AI is no longer a luxury. It’s a necessity.</p>
        <p>Small business owners are now exploring AI solutions that were once only accessible to multinational corporations. Let’s dive into the key ways AI is transforming small businesses in 2025.</p>

        <h2>1. Automating Daily Operations</h2>
        <p>AI allows small businesses to automate routine tasks, freeing up valuable time for strategy and growth. Scheduling tools, smart inventory management, and AI-powered bookkeeping are helping businesses reduce errors and save costs. For instance, automated invoicing platforms can generate invoices, send reminders, and reconcile accounts automatically.</p>

        <h2>3. Personalized Customer Experience</h2>

        <p>Examples of platforms: <strong>Salesforce Einstein</strong>, <strong>Freshworks</strong>, <strong>Drift</strong></p>

        <h2>4. Predictive Analytics for Smarter Decisions</h2>

        <h2>5. AI Chatbots for Customer Support</h2>

        <h2>6. Affordable AI Tools for Small Businesses</h2>
