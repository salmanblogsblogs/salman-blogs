      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Hello! I'm <strong>Salman Ahmad</strong>. Your Computer Science teacher and also a web developer. In this lesson we're going to dig into the fundamentals of web development. 
        If you've ever asked yourself how websites are built, why some pages look pretty while others don't, or how interactive things on a page work, this guide is for you.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        We'll cover the basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), why each one matters, how they work together, and practical tips you can use to build simple web pages. There are examples, revision notes, MCQs, and extra sections like responsive design, performance tips, security basics, hosting and deployment, and career advice so you get a full picture.
      </p>

      <div class="tip">
        Quick practical idea: open your browser and press <strong>Ctrl+U</strong> (or right-click → View Page Source) to see HTML. Then press <strong>F12</strong> to open DevTools and poke CSS & JavaScript live. It's the fastest way to learn.
      </div>

      <!-- Expanded: How HTML, CSS, JS work together -->
      <h2 class="section-title">How HTML, CSS and JavaScript Work Together (the big picture)</h2>
          <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p class="lead">
        Think of a website like a human body:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML is the skeleton:</strong> it provides structure by using headings, paragraphs, images, tables etc.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS is the clothing and makeup:</strong> it makes the structure look attractive by using colors, spacing, alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript is the muscles and nerves:</strong> it makes things move and respond.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="lead">
        When someone types a web address in the browser, the browser requests HTML from a server. The server responds with HTML, which the browser parses into a DOM (Document Object Model). CSS files referenced in the HTML are downloaded and applied to the DOM to style it. JavaScript runs and can change the DOM in real time, making the page interactive.
      </p>

      <div class="two-col">
        <div class="col">
          <h3>Simple Example: A heading with color and a click</h3>
          <div class="code">
&lt;!-- HTML -- &gt;
&lt;h1 id="title"&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
&lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- styles.css --&gt;
#title { color: blue; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }

&lt;!-- script.js --&gt;
document.getElementById('title').addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('You clicked the title!');
});
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h3>What happens</h3>
          <p class="lead">HTML creates the &lt;h1&gt; element, CSS gives it blue color and a font, and JavaScript listens for a click and shows an alert. That simple trio demonstrates structure, style, and behavior.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Expanded: Browser, Server, Client-Server model -->
      <h2 class="section-title">Browser, Server &amp; the Client-Server Model</h2>
        <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p class="lead">
        The web works on a client-server model. The browser (client) requests resources; the server responds. This request/response loop uses the HTTP protocol (or HTTPS for secure sites).
      </p>

      <h3>What is a browser?</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        A browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) renders HTML and CSS, runs JavaScript, and provides developer tools to inspect structure, style, and network requests. Browsers also implement security measures (same-origin policy, CORS).
      </p>

      <h3>What is a server?</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        A server is a computer that stores website files and responds to HTTP requests. When you visit example.com, your browser asks the server for index.html; the server sends files back.
      </p>

      <h3>HTTP and HTTPS (basic idea)</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the set of rules for requesting and delivering web content. HTTPS is HTTP over TLS/SSL. It encrypts the data between browser and server so eavesdroppers cannot read it.
      </p>

      <div class="tip">
        Tip: always prefer HTTPS for real sites. Browsers mark non-HTTPS pages as “Not secure.”
      </div>

      <!-- Expanded: HTML basics - tags, semantics, accessibility -->
      <h2 class="section-title">HTML Essentials: Tags, Semantics and Accessibility</h2>
              <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p class="lead">
        HTML uses tags like &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;form&gt; and more. Modern best-practice is to use <em>semantic</em> tags (like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;) so the page is easier to read for humans, search engines and assistive technologies.
      </p>

      <h3>Accessibility (a11y) basics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <code>alt</code> attributes for images: &lt;img src="photo.jpg" alt="A child reading a book"&gt;</li>
        <li>Use proper heading order (h1 → h2 → h3) so screen readers can follow structure.</li>
        <li>Label forms correctly with &lt;label for="name"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt; and input IDs.</li>
        <li>Ensure contrast between text and background for readability.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip">
        Accessibility is not optional. It helps people who use screen readers, improves SEO, and broadens your audience.
      </div>

      <!-- Expanded: CSS essentials -->
      <h2 class="section-title">CSS Essentials: Selectors, Box Model and Responsive Layouts</h2>
              <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p class="lead">
        CSS controls how HTML looks. Some key concepts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Selectors:</strong> Choose elements to style (element, class, ID, attribute selectors).</li>
        <li><strong>Box model:</strong> Every element has content, padding, border, margin. Learning this helps with layout and spacing.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexbox & Grid:</strong> Modern layout systems. Flexbox is great for single-dimensional layouts, Grid is powerful for two-dimensional layouts.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> Media queries let your site adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Example: simple responsive rule</h3>
      <div class="code">
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .sidebar { display: none; }
  .content { width: 100%; }
}
      </div>

      <!-- Expanded: JavaScript essentials -->
      <h2 class="section-title">JavaScript Essentials: Interaction, DOM and APIs</h2>
              <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p class="lead">
        JavaScript runs in the browser to make pages interactive:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DOM (Document Object Model):</strong> JavaScript can add/remove/change HTML elements in the DOM.</li>
        <li><strong>Events:</strong> Clicks, input, scroll — JS listens for events to react.</li>
        <li><strong>APIs:</strong> Fetch data from servers (AJAX/fetch), work with browser storage, Web APIs like Geolocation or Canvas.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Small example: fetch API</h3>
      <div class="code">
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(resp =&gt; resp.json())
  .then(data =&gt; console.log(data));
      </div>

      <!-- Expanded: Tools & Workflow -->

              <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p class="lead">
        Real web development uses tools that speed up work and keep projects organized:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Code editors:</strong> VS Code, Sublime, Atom (VS Code is widely used).</li>
        <li><strong>Browser DevTools:</strong> Inspect DOM/CSS, debug JS, audit performance and accessibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Version control (Git):</strong> Track changes and collaborate with others. Platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.</li>
        <li><strong>Package managers and build tools:</strong> npm/yarn, and bundlers like Vite, Webpack for modern JS projects.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip">
        Practical workflow: write code locally → test in browser → commit to Git → push to GitHub → deploy (e.g., Netlify or GitHub Pages).

      <!-- Expanded: Responsive Design & Mobile-first -->
      <h2 class="section-title">Responsive Design & Mobile-First Approach</h2>
              <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p class="lead">
        Most web traffic is on mobile. Build mobile-first: design for small screens first, then scale up. Use flexible units (%, rem) and media queries.
      </p>

      <h3>Checklist for responsive pages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fluid layouts that adapt to screen width</li>
        <li>Images that scale with CSS (<code>max-width:100%</code>)</li>
        <li>Readable font sizes (use <code>rem</code>)</li>

      <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

      <h3>Q1: Where should I start if I'm a complete beginner?</h3>
      <p>Start with HTML: learn basic tags like &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;/&lt;ol&gt;. Then add CSS to style your page and finally JavaScript to add simple interactivity. Build very small projects as you go.</p>

      <h3>Q2: How long does it take to build a real website?</h3>
      <p>For a simple static website (personal page or portfolio) it can take a few days to a week if you learn as you build. Larger, dynamic websites take longer. Consistent practice shortens the learning curve.</p>

      <h3>Q3: Do I need to learn frameworks like React or Vue immediately?</h3>
      <p>No. Learn the core languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) first. Frameworks make development faster but they assume you know the basics.</p>

      <h3>Q4: Can I make money with web development?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Web development skills can lead to jobs (frontend developer, UI/UX designer), freelance work, or your own online business. Start with small freelance jobs or local businesses.</p>

      <h3>Q5: What is the difference between a web designer and a web developer?</h3>
      <p>A web designer focuses on visual appearance and user experience (UI/UX), while a web developer turns designs into functioning websites using code. Many people do both when starting out.</p>

      <h3>Q6: How do I practice safely when learning?</h3>
      <p>Use local development (your computer) or GitHub Pages / Netlify for hosting demo sites. Never publish sensitive data (passwords, API keys) in public repos.</p>

      <h3>Q7: Any tips for studying for exams?</h3>
      <p>Use the Full Definitions to understand concepts deeply, then memorize Quick Notes for fast revision. Practice small code snippets and be prepared to explain what HTML/CSS/JS do in simple terms.</p>

      <div class="tip">
        Final note from me: build something small today. Even a single page that says "Hello, I'm learning web dev" and a button that changes color when clicked — that's progress, and it teaches you the complete flow from idea → code → browser.
