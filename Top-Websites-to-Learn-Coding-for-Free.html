        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Learning to code in 2025 is easier than ever. There are high-quality, free learning platforms that give you real skills without a big cost. This guide covers ten websites that are tested, trusted, and still free in their core offerings. For each platform you will find: what it teaches, who it is best for, real examples of projects you can build, a short list of pros and cons, and tips to get the most from it.</p>

        <p>This is written in simple language so anyone, a student, a career switcher, or someone curious can follow. If you want to become a web developer, a data person, or just understand how software works, pick one site and stick with it long enough to finish a few projects. Consistency and projects matter more than the number of courses you open.</p>

        <h2>How to pick the right free platform</h2>
        <p>Before the list, a quick note on choosing: decide what kind of work you want to do (web, mobile, data, or general programming). Then choose a platform that offers projects and a path in that area. If you want a structured path, pick freeCodeCamp or The Odin Project. If you want a strong university-style foundation, choose Harvard CS50 or MIT OpenCourseWare. For practice and interview prep, HackerRank and GeeksforGeeks are excellent. Use one primary platform and one secondary resource for problems and references.</p>

        <h2 id="coursera">10. Coursera (Audit Free Courses) — University-style courses</h2>
        <p><strong>Official site:</strong> <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coursera.org</a></p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p><strong>What it teaches:</strong> University-level courses from top institutions and companies (Stanford, Google, IBM). You can audit many courses for free (watch videos, read materials) and pay only if you want a certificate or graded assignments.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it stands out:</strong> Access to high-quality instructors and up-to-date content. Good for learning specialized skills like machine learning, cloud computing, and modern web frameworks.</p>
        <p><strong>Example project:</strong> Audit a “Machine Learning” or “Cloud Fundamentals” course and follow along with the labs and capstone projects (you can do labs with free-tier cloud accounts or local setups).</p>
        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> High-quality content, structured learning paths, and the option to get certificates.</p>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Graded projects often require payment; some specializations assume prior knowledge.</p>
        <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Use audit mode to learn for free. If a course includes optional labs requiring cloud credits, try local alternatives or free-tier cloud accounts to complete exercises.</p>

        <h2>How to turn free learning into a job</h2>
        <p>Free learning is effective when you pair it with real projects and public proof of work. Employers want to see problem-solving ability and results. Follow this simple plan:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Pick a focused path (for example, front-end web or data analysis).</li>
          <li>Complete a full course or track on one platform (freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project or CS50).</li>
          <li>Build 3-5 portfolio projects and publish code on GitHub with clear README files.</li>
          <li>Practice algorithm problems weekly on HackerRank or LeetCode for interviews.</li>
          <li>Create a simple personal site showcasing projects and links to live demos.</li>
          <li>Network: join communities, contribute to open-source or attend local meetups.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (expanded)</h2>
        <div class="faq">
          <h3>Can I learn to code for free and get a job?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Many developers start with free resources. The most important parts are consistency, building real projects, and demonstrating your work. Employers hire people who can solve problems and show results, not just certificates.</p>

          <h3>Which platform is best for a complete beginner?</h3>
          <p>For absolute beginners, Codecademy (free lessons), Khan Academy and W3Schools are excellent starting points. Once comfortable, move to project-based curricula like freeCodeCamp or The Odin Project.</p>

          <h3>How long does it take to become job-ready?</h3>
          <p>Time varies. With focused study and consistent project work, many learners reach entry-level readiness in 6–12 months. Full-time bootcamp speed can be faster, but free learning requires disciplined practice.</p>

          <h3>Do I need to pay for certificates?</h3>
          <p>Certificates can help, but they are not required. A strong portfolio and practical experience are often more persuasive. Use paid certificates only if they add value for your target job or employer.</p>

          <h3>Should I focus on one language or many?</h3>
          <p>Start with one language (for example, JavaScript or Python) and get comfortable. Later, learn additional languages and tools as needed for projects or job requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>Free coding resources in 2025 are powerful and mature. You can learn everything from the basics to advanced topics without paying upfront. The trick is to pick a platform that fits your learning style, commit to finishing lessons and most importantly build public projects that show what you can do.</p>
        <p>Start small, keep a steady routine, and measure progress through projects, not only completed lessons. If you want, use freeCodeCamp or The Odin Project for a full path, add HackerRank for interview prep, and reference MIT OCW or CS50 for deeper theory. This combination will give you practical skills, problem-solving strength, and the kind of portfolio that gets noticed.</p>
