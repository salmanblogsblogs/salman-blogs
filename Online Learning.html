        <h2>6. Opportunities for Networking and Collaboration</h2>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Online platforms often include discussion boards, group projects, and virtual networking events. You can build a professional network with peers from around the world — expanding your career opportunities.</p>

        <h2>7. Learning at Your Own Pace</h2>

          <li>Quality varies — not all online courses are created equal</li>
        </ul>
