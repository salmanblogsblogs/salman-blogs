      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        These lecture notes are prepared by <strong>Salman Ahmad</strong>, who is both a <strong>teacher</strong> and a <strong>web developer</strong>.  
        The purpose of this material is to make the topic <em>Introduction to Networks</em> clear and useful for students of Class 9 Computer Science.  
        Networking is not only a theoretical subject for exams. It is also the backbone of modern digital communication, from the Internet you use daily to the mobile apps you rely on.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In this lecture, you will learn the <strong>basic concepts of networks</strong>, including definitions, important devices, real-life analogies, and multiple-choice questions (MCQs).  
        The notes are designed to be easy to understand and exam-oriented while also giving you practical insights into how networks shape our world.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p>
        Today, almost every device we use is connected to some form of network. Whether you are chatting with friends, attending an online class, streaming videos, or playing games, networks make it possible.  
        By learning the basics of networking now, you are preparing yourself for more advanced topics such as <strong>cybersecurity, cloud computing, IoT, and web development</strong>.  
        Without networks, the Internet, the greatest invention of the modern age, simply would not exist.
      </p>

      <h2>Full Definitions</h2>
      <h3>Computer Network</h3>
      <p>
        A computer network is a system of two or more connected devices (such as computers, printers, and smartphones) 
        that can exchange data and share resources. It allows communication and collaboration between devices. 
        Networks can be small, like a Local Area Network (LAN) inside a home or office, or very large, like a 
        Wide Area Network (WAN), which includes the Internet.
      </p>

      <h3>Nodes</h3>
      <p>
        Nodes are the devices connected to a network. These devices can send, receive, or process data. 
        Examples include computers, smartphones, tablets, servers, and printers. Each node in a network has an address that identifies it.
      </p>

      <h3>Links</h3>
      <p>
        Links are the communication channels that connect nodes together in a network. They can be wired links 
        (like Ethernet cables and fiber optic cables) or wireless links (like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or mobile signals). 
        Links allow data to travel between devices.
      </p>

      <h3>Switches</h3>
      <p>
        A switch is a device used inside a network to connect multiple nodes. It receives data packets, reads their 
        destination MAC address, and forwards them only to the correct device. 
        This makes communication efficient and secure.
      </p>

      <h3>Routers</h3>
      <p>
        A router is a device that connects different networks together, such as connecting a home network (LAN) to the Internet (WAN). 
        Routers read the destination IP address of data packets and choose the best path to deliver them to the final destination.
      </p>

      <h3>Packet Switching Example (File Transfer)</h3>
      <p>
        When you send a file to another computer in the network, the file is broken into smaller parts called packets. 
        Each packet has a destination address. A switch forwards the packets only to the correct device. 
        The receiving computer reassembles the packets into the complete file.
      </p>

      <h3>Analogy: Air Travel System</h3>
      <p>
        Computer networks work like air travel:
        <br>Passengers = Data
        <br>Groups of passengers = Packets
        <br>Flights = Paths data takes
        <br>Airports = Routers
        <br>Even if groups (packets) take different flights (paths) through different airports (routers), 
        they still reach the same destination.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Networks</h2>
        <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p>
        Networks can be classified into different types depending on size, distance, and purpose:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> Covers a small area such as a school, office, or home.</li>
        <li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> Covers large areas, often across countries. The Internet is the largest WAN.</li>
        <li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):</strong> Covers a city or town, larger than LAN but smaller than WAN.</li>
        <li><strong>PAN (Personal Area Network):</strong> Very small network around a single person, e.g., connecting a phone with Bluetooth headphones.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Applications of Networks</h2>
        <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p>Networks play an important role in almost every sector of life:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Online classes, digital libraries, and learning platforms like Google Classroom.</li>
        <li><strong>Business:</strong> Email, video conferencing, cloud storage, and online transactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Telemedicine, patient record sharing, and remote monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Government:</strong> E-governance, online services, and secure communication systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Life:</strong> Social media, online shopping, video streaming, and mobile apps.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>History of Networks</h2>
        <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p>
        The history of computer networking started in the 1960s with <strong>ARPANET</strong>, which was the first operational packet-switching network.  
        It later grew into what we now know as the Internet. Over decades, networks evolved from simple wired connections to advanced wireless systems, including <strong>4G, 5G, and fiber optics</strong>.  
        Understanding this history helps students appreciate how quickly technology has advanced.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. What is the main purpose of a computer network?</h3>
        <p>The primary purpose of a computer network is to allow devices to communicate, share data, and access resources efficiently, whether within a small area (LAN) or over long distances (WAN).</p>

        <h3>2. How do switches differ from routers?</h3>
        <p>Switches connect multiple devices within the same network and forward data to the correct device, while routers connect different networks and determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination.</p>

        <h3>3. Can a network work without a router?</h3>
        <p>Yes, a small local network (LAN) can work with just switches, hubs, or direct connections, but for connecting to other networks or the Internet, a router is required.</p>

        <h3>4. What is the difference between LAN and WAN?</h3>
        <p>LAN (Local Area Network) covers a small area like a home or office, while WAN (Wide Area Network) spans large geographic areas, including cities or countries, and often uses the Internet for connectivity.</p>

        <h3>5. Why is understanding packet switching important?</h3>
        <p>Packet switching allows efficient and reliable data transfer by breaking files into smaller packets that can take different paths to reach the destination, ensuring faster delivery and better use of network resources.</p>
