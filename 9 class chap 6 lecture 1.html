      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        These notes are based on a classroom lecture delivered by <strong>Salman Ahmad</strong>, 
        who is both a <strong>teacher</strong> and a <strong>web developer</strong>. 
        The goal of these notes is to make <strong>Introduction To Networks</strong> easier to understand 
        for students preparing for exams, revising concepts, or simply wanting a 
        quick but complete explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this lecture, we covered the importance of computer networks, their definitions, practical examples, 
        and multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to strengthen understanding. These notes are written in a way 
        that students from all levels can benefit, whether they are studying in class 
        or learning online.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding computer networks is essential not only for exams but also for real-world technology. 
        Networks are the backbone of the internet, communication systems, and even online gaming. 
        Grasping how devices connect and exchange data will help students in future courses like cybersecurity, 
        web development, and IT infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h2>Full Definitions</h2>
      <h3>Computer Network</h3>
      <p>
        A computer network is a system of two or more connected devices (such as computers, printers, and smartphones) 
        that can exchange data and share resources. It allows communication and collaboration between devices. 
        Networks can be small, like a Local Area Network (LAN) inside a home or office, or very large, like a 
        Wide Area Network (WAN), which includes the Internet.
      </p>

      <h3>Nodes</h3>
      <p>
        Nodes are the devices connected to a network. These devices can send, receive, or process data. 
        Examples include computers, smartphones, tablets, servers, and printers. Each node in a network has an address that identifies it.
      </p>

      <h3>Links</h3>
      <p>
        Links are the communication channels that connect nodes together in a network. They can be wired links 
        (like Ethernet cables and fiber optic cables) or wireless links (like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or mobile signals). 
        Links allow data to travel between devices.
      </p>

      <h3>Switches</h3>
      <p>
        A switch is a device used inside a network to connect multiple nodes. It receives data packets, reads their 
        destination MAC address, and forwards them only to the correct device. 
        This makes communication efficient and secure.
      </p>

      <h3>Routers</h3>
      <p>
        A router is a device that connects different networks together, such as connecting a home network (LAN) to the Internet (WAN). 
        Routers read the destination IP address of data packets and choose the best path to deliver them to the final destination.
      </p>

      <h3>Packet Switching Example (File Transfer)</h3>
      <p>
        When you send a file to another computer in the network, the file is broken into smaller parts called packets. 
        Each packet has a destination address. A switch forwards the packets only to the correct device. 
        The receiving computer reassembles the packets into the complete file.
      </p>

      <h3>Analogy: Air Travel System</h3>
      <p>
        Computer networks work like air travel:
        <br>Passengers = Data
        <br>Groups of passengers = Packets
        <br>Flights = Paths data takes
        <br>Airports = Routers
        <br>Even if groups (packets) take different flights (paths) through different airports (routers), 
        they still reach the same destination.
      </p>

      <h2>Extra Tip: Practical Observation</h2>
      <p>
        A simple way to observe networking in action is to check how multiple devices in your home connect to Wi-Fi. 
        Try sending files between your phone, laptop, or tablet. Watch how routers and switches manage data efficiently. 
        This practical observation helps you connect theory with real-world usage.
      </p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq">
  <h3>1. What is the main purpose of a computer network?</h3>
  <p>The primary purpose of a computer network is to allow devices to communicate, share data, and access resources efficiently, whether within a small area (LAN) or over long distances (WAN).</p>

  <h3>2. How do switches differ from routers?</h3>
  <p>Switches connect multiple devices within the same network and forward data to the correct device, while routers connect different networks and determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination.</p>

  <h3>3. Can a network work without a router?</h3>
  <p>Yes, a small local network (LAN) can work with just switches, hubs, or direct connections, but for connecting to other networks or the Internet, a router is required.</p>

  <h3>4. What is the difference between LAN and WAN?</h3>
  <p>LAN (Local Area Network) covers a small area like a home or office, while WAN (Wide Area Network) spans large geographic areas, including cities or countries, and often uses the Internet for connectivity.</p>

  <h3>5. Why is understanding packet switching important?</h3>
  <p>Packet switching allows efficient and reliable data transfer by breaking files into smaller packets that can take different paths to reach the destination, ensuring faster delivery and better use of network resources.</p>
