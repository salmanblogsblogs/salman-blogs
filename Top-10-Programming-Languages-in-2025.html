        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>No single programming language guarantees success. Employers value problem-solving, clean code, and the ability to learn. Pick a language aligned with your goals, complete real projects, and learn the ecosystem around it (databases, cloud, testing). Over time, moving between languages becomes easier. What matters most is the developer mindset and hands-on experience.</p>
