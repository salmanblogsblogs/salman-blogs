      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Technology keeps changing, but some skills stay useful. In 2025, employers look for developers who can solve problems, work with data, and build reliable systems. Programming languages are tools. Each tool fits different jobs. This article explains the ten most important languages today. For every language you’ll read: what it is, why it matters, common uses, who hires for it, how to start learning, and what to expect from a career using that language. I wrote this in plain English so anyone, student, career-changer or curious reader can understand and choose a path that fits their goals.</p>

      <h2>How to use this guide</h2>
      <p>Read the introduction and the short summary for each language. If you are new, focus on languages marked as beginner-friendly. If you already code, read the sections on career paths and real-world uses to plan your next steps.</p>
