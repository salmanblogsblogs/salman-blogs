      <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Salman Ahmad</strong>. I am both a teacher and a web developer, and I am excited to guide you through the fascinating journey of learning web development. In this lecture, we will begin with one of the most fundamental building blocks of the web that's <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong>.</p>
      <p>Whether you want to design websites, develop applications, or simply understand how the internet works, HTML is where it all begins. Think of it as the foundation of a house: without a solid base, nothing else can stand firmly. By learning HTML, you will be able to create the structure of web pages, organize text, embed images, add links, and much more. For Class 9 Computer Science students, this lecture is designed to not only help you grasp the technical details but also to inspire curiosity about how the digital world is built.</p>
      <p>We will explore the <strong>history of HTML</strong>, learn about its different versions, understand how to set up a development environment, and review key points through <strong>quick notes</strong> and <strong>MCQs</strong>. I will also add a summary and FAQs at the end so you can revise and clear common doubts. Let’s get started!</p>

      <!-- FULL DEFINITIONS -->
      <h2>Full Definitions</h2>
      <h3>8.3 Getting Started with HTML</h3>
      <p>HTML is the standard language used to create web pages. It acts like building blocks that come together to form the structure of a website, similar to how LEGO pieces fit together to build a model.</p>

      <h3>8.3.1 History of HTML</h3>
      <p>HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 to make sharing information on the internet easy. Since then, HTML has evolved through several versions to add more features and improve usability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML 1.0 (1991):</strong> The first version, simple with basic features for text and links.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML 2.0 (1995):</strong> Added more tags and features for complex pages.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML 3.2 (1997):</strong> Introduced tags for tables, scripts, and applets.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML 4.0 (1997):</strong> Major improvements including multimedia support (images, videos).</li>
        <li><strong>HTML 4.01 (1999):</strong> Minor improvements to version 4.0.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML5 (2014):</strong> The latest version, with better multimedia, graphics, and interactive elements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8.3.2 Setting up a Development Environment</h3>
      <p>To create websites, you need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Text Editor:</strong> A program where you write your HTML code, such as Notepad++, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Browser:</strong> A program to open and test your HTML files, like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.</li>
      </ul>

      
      <h2>Understanding HTML in Depth</h2>
        <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p>HTML is not a programming language. It is a <strong>markup language</strong>. This means it does not perform calculations or logic like Java or Python. Instead, HTML uses <strong>tags</strong> to mark elements on a web page, telling the browser how to display them. For example, headings, paragraphs, images, and links are all created with HTML tags. Once you understand these tags, you can begin shaping web content exactly how you want.</p>
      <p>One of the best things about HTML is that it is <strong>human-readable</strong>. Unlike binary code or complex syntax-heavy languages, HTML is easy to pick up even for beginners. If you write <code>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, anyone can guess that it is a heading saying “Welcome.” This simplicity is one reason HTML has remained the backbone of the internet for decades.</p>

      <h3>The Importance of HTML Versions</h3>
      <p>Each new version of HTML was released to meet the demands of its time. For example, HTML 4.0 brought in multimedia when the internet started becoming more visual. HTML5, on the other hand, was created in the age of smartphones, apps, and streaming media. It introduced video and audio tags, canvas for graphics, and semantic elements like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to give better structure. This adaptability is what has kept HTML relevant as technology continues to evolve.</p>

      <h3>Setting Up Your Environment Properly</h3>
      <p>Before diving into coding, it is important to set up a proper workspace. A text editor is where all the coding magic happens. Modern editors like Visual Studio Code not only allow you to write HTML but also provide features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and extensions that make development faster and easier. Pairing this with a browser like Chrome lets you test and preview your work instantly.</p>

      <h3>Applications of HTML</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Websites:</strong> HTML forms the structure of every website you visit, from blogs to e-commerce stores.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Applications:</strong> Combined with CSS and JavaScript, HTML powers apps like Gmail, YouTube, and Facebook.</li>
        <li><strong>Online Education:</strong> Platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera deliver lessons using HTML as their foundation.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Templates:</strong> Many marketing emails are built with HTML for layout and design.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> Frameworks like Ionic and PhoneGap allow developers to use HTML to build cross-platform mobile apps.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- FAQs -->
      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <h3>1. Is HTML a programming language?</h3>
      <p>No, HTML is a markup language. It structures content on the web but does not perform logical operations or calculations like a programming language.</p>

      <h3>2. Do I need to install anything to start HTML coding?</h3>
      <p>You don’t need special software. A simple text editor (like Notepad) and a browser are enough. However, professional developers often use advanced editors like Visual Studio Code for convenience.</p>

      <h3>3. Why are there so many versions of HTML?</h3>
      <p>Each version was created to keep up with technological needs. For example, HTML 4.0 supported multimedia, while HTML5 supports modern interactive web apps and mobile-friendly designs.</p>

      <h3>4. Can HTML alone create a full website?</h3>
      <p>HTML provides structure, but websites also need CSS for design and JavaScript for interactivity. Together, they make a complete website.</p>

      <h3>5. How long does it take to learn HTML?</h3>
      <p>Basic HTML can be learned in a few days, but mastering it with best practices and combining it with CSS and JavaScript may take weeks or months depending on practice.</p>
