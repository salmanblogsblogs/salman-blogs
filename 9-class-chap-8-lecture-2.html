      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello students, my name is <strong>Salman Ahmad</strong>. I am both a <strong>teacher</strong> and a <strong>web developer</strong>, and in this lecture, we will explore one of the most exciting topics in modern computer science: <em>the basic components of web development</em>.</p>
      <p>In today’s world, websites are everywhere, from educational platforms, online shopping stores, banking portals, government services, entertainment, and social media. Every click you make, every form you fill, and every video you watch is possible because of the combination of front-end, back-end, and full-stack web development.</p>
      <p>This lecture will give you a solid understanding of these components. By the end, you will not only know the definitions but also see how these concepts work together in the real world. This will be extremely useful whether you want to pursue computer science, become a software engineer, or even start freelancing as a web developer.</p>

      <h2>FULL DEFINITIONS</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Front-end Development (What the user sees)</strong>
          <p><strong>HTML</strong> – Structures the content on the page (headings, paragraphs, images, links).</p>
          <p><strong>CSS</strong> – CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the design and layout of web pages, including colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and overall visual appearance.</p>
          <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> – JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic, allowing features like form validation, animations, games, and real-time updates.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Back-end Development (What happens behind the scenes)</strong>
          <p><strong>Web Servers</strong> – Computers that store and deliver websites to users.</p>
          <p><strong>Databases</strong> – Store and manage information (like usernames, products).</p>
          <p><strong>Back-end Programming Languages</strong> – Languages like PHP, Python, Ruby that process data and handle features such as login systems.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Full-Stack Development (Front-end + Back-end)</strong>
          <p>A Full-Stack Developer works on both sides, they create the User Interface for the front-end and also handle the back-end tasks like user authentication and database management.</p>
          <p><strong>Example: Login System</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Front-end:</strong> The login form where users type their username and password.</p>
          <p><strong>Back-end:</strong> Checking the username and password against the database and allowing access.</p>
          <p><strong>Full-stack:</strong> Doing both the form design and the user authentication process.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Quick Notes – Basic Components of Web Development</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Front-end Development</strong> – Builds what users see and interact with on a website (layout, buttons, menus).</li>
        <li><strong>HTML</strong> – Structures the content of web pages (headings, paragraphs, images, links).</li>
        <li><strong>CSS</strong> – Styles the content of web pages (colors, fonts, spacing, layouts).</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> – Adds interactivity to web pages (forms, animations, games).</li>
        <li><strong>Back-end Development</strong> – Manages the behind-the-scenes functionality of a website (servers, databases, application logic).</li>
        <li><strong>Web Servers</strong> – Store and deliver web pages to users when they visit a site.</li>
        <li><strong>Databases</strong> – Store and organize data such as user details, products, or posts.</li>
        <li><strong>Back-end Languages</strong> – Programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby that process data and handle tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Full-stack Development</strong> – Combines front-end and back-end skills to create complete websites or applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Login System Example</strong> – Front-end shows the login form, back-end checks details in the database, full-stack developer builds both parts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Learn Web Development?</h2>
          <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
      <p>Web development is not just about building websites. It is about creating digital solutions that help businesses grow, connect people globally, and solve real-world problems. From social media platforms to online classrooms, everything relies on front-end and back-end integration. Learning these skills can open career opportunities in software engineering, freelancing, and entrepreneurship.</p>

      <h2>Tools Commonly Used in Web Development</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Front-end:</strong> VS Code, React, Angular, Bootstrap</li>
        <li><strong>Back-end:</strong> Node.js, Django, Laravel, Express</li>
        <li><strong>Databases:</strong> MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL</li>
        <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git and GitHub</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges in Web Development</h2>
      <p>Some of the challenges developers face include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Making websites responsive for mobile and desktop.</li>
        <li>Ensuring security against hackers.</li>
        <li>Optimizing website performance for speed.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>In this lecture, we explored the three basic components of web development: front-end, back-end, and full-stack. We also discussed real-world examples, career opportunities, common tools, and challenges faced by developers. Understanding these basics is the foundation for building your skills in computer science and web technologies. As your teacher and mentor, I encourage you to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript regularly, and gradually move into server-side programming to become a well-rounded developer.</p>

      <h2>FAQs on Web Development</h2>
      <ol>
