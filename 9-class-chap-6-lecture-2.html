        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This lecture is prepared by <strong>Salman Ahmad</strong>, a teacher and web developer, 
          with the aim of making the subject of <strong>Computer Networks and Data Communication</strong> 
          simple, clear, and exam-friendly for students of Class 9. While textbooks often give 
          short definitions, these notes explain concepts with examples, applications, and real-life use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Computer networks are the invisible systems that allow us to connect with the world. 
          Every time we send a message, watch a video online, attend an online class, or even 
          transfer a file, we are using a network. Data communication is at the heart of this process. 
          To understand modern computing, it is impossible to ignore these topics. This lecture is 
          a step-by-step journey into the basics of networks and communication systems.
        </p>

        <h2>History & Importance</h2>
            <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
        <p>
          The idea of connecting computers began in the 1960s, when the U.S. Department of Defense 
          started a project called ARPANET. This later evolved into the Internet. 
          At first, networking was only used by scientists and universities, 
          but today it has become a part of daily life. From smart homes and banking 
          systems to e-learning and online shopping, networking enables everything. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Without networks, computers would remain isolated machines, and 
          communication would be limited to physical transfer of data using USBs or disks. 
          The importance of computer networks lies in saving time, improving communication, 
          and making global collaboration possible.
        </p>

        <h2>Full Definitions</h2>

        <h3>Objectives of Computer Networks</h3>
        <p>The main purpose of a computer network is to allow devices and users to share resources, communicate, and collaborate effectively.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Networks allow multiple devices to share resources (printers, storage, etc.), reducing costs and increasing efficiency. <em>Example:</em> In an office, several computers share one printer instead of each having its own.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Communication:</strong> Networks enable the transfer of data between users, making communication faster and easier through emails, instant messaging, and video conferencing. <em>Example:</em> Teams in different countries use Zoom or Microsoft Teams to collaborate.</li>
          <li><strong>Connectivity & Collaboration:</strong> Networks connect devices, making remote work and teamwork possible through real-time access to shared documents and cloud services. <em>Example:</em> A group edits a document together using Google Drive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fundamental Concepts in Data Communication</h3>
        <p>Data communication is the process of exchanging data between a sender and a receiver through a medium, using a defined protocol.</p>

        <h4>5 Components of Data Communication</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sender:</strong> The device that sends the data. <em>Example:</em> A computer sending an email.</li>
          <li><strong>Receiver:</strong> The device that receives the data. <em>Example:</em> A smartphone receiving the email.</li>
          <li><strong>Message:</strong> The actual data being communicated. <em>Example:</em> The text/content of the email.</li>
          <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> The set of rules that governs data communication. <em>Example:</em> HTTP (used for websites), SMTP (used for emails).</li>
          <li><strong>Medium:</strong> The channel/path through which the data travels (wire or wireless). <em>Example:</em> Ethernet cable, Wi-Fi, or fiber optic cable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Networks</h2>
            <strong>Extra[You can skip this during writing on notebooks. It is just an extra knowledge.]</strong>
        <p>
          Networks are not just theoretical concepts; they play a role in nearly every field. 
          In education, students attend online classes. In healthcare, doctors use 
          telemedicine to treat patients remotely. In businesses, teams collaborate 
          using shared platforms. Even entertainment, like Netflix and YouTube, 
          would not exist without strong networking systems.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> E-learning platforms like Google Classroom rely on networks.</li>
          <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Patient reports are shared online for faster diagnosis.</li>
          <li><strong>Banking:</strong> ATMs and online banking depend entirely on secure networks.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram connect billions daily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq">
          <h3>1. Why do we need computer networks in daily life?</h3>
          <p>We need networks because they allow us to communicate instantly, share files, attend online classes, 
          and perform tasks like online banking and shopping without physical barriers.</p>

          <h3>2. How is data communication different from networking?</h3>
          <p>Networking is the overall system of connecting devices, while data communication is the process of 
          transferring information between those connected devices using rules and protocols.</p>

          <h3>3. What is the role of protocols in data communication?</h3>
          <p>Protocols act like languages. Just as two people need a common language to understand each other, 
          computers need protocols like HTTP or SMTP to communicate successfully.</p>

          <h3>4. Can a network exist without the Internet?</h3>
          <p>Yes, a small LAN can exist without the Internet, such as in an office where computers share files and printers locally.</p>

          <h3>5. What career fields require strong knowledge of networks?</h3>
          <p>IT support, system administration, cybersecurity, software development, and cloud computing are just 
          some fields where networking knowledge is essential.</p>
